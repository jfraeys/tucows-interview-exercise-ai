# Domain Suspension Guidelines

## 1. Common Reasons for Suspension
- **Invalid WHOIS Data**: If the registrant’s email or address cannot be verified, the domain may be suspended.
  - Ensure email addresses are up-to-date and verified.
  - Maintain correct billing and contact information.
- **Abuse or Policy Violation**: Domains used for spam, phishing, or illegal activity will be suspended immediately.
  - Monitor domain usage for compliance with terms of service.
  - Respond promptly to any abuse alerts.
- **Billing Issues**: Unpaid invoices or expired payment methods may result in suspension.
  - Set up auto-pay or reminders for renewals.
  - Update payment methods proactively.

## 2. Suspension Notification
Notifications include:
- The domain(s) affected by suspension.
- Specific reason(s) for suspension.
- Detailed corrective actions required.
- Links to relevant support resources or FAQ pages.
- Timeline for expected resolution if the actions are completed correctly.

Notifications are sent via:
- Email to the account's registered address.
