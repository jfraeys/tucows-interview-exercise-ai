Customer Support FAQ: Domain Reactivation

Q1: Why was my domain suspended?
A: There are several possible reasons:
1. WHOIS contact details were invalid or not verified.
2. The domain was flagged for abuse (spam, phishing, malware).
3. Your payment method failed during renewal.

Q2: How can I fix this?
A:
- Update your WHOIS details in the account dashboard.
- Check your billing method and update payment details.
- If you received an abuse warning, reply to the ticket or contact the Abuse Team.

Q3: How long does it take for my domain to be reactivated?
A: Normally within 24–48 hours once the issue is resolved.

Q4: Who should I contact if I think this was a mistake?
A: You should escalate the ticket to our Abuse Team, including:
- Domain name
- Ticket reference number
- Any proof of compliance

Q5: Can I reactivate my domain myself?
A: For billing or WHOIS issues, yes. For abuse-related suspensions, you may need approval from the Abuse Team.

Q6: Will my website be offline during suspension?
A: Yes, suspended domains will not resolve to your website until the issue is resolved.

Q7: Do I get notified before suspension?
A: In most cases, we attempt to notify the registrant via email. However, missed notifications can happen due to invalid WHOIS contacts.

Q8: What documents are required to verify my domain ownership?
A: Valid ID, proof of business registration (if applicable), or confirmation emails from your account dashboard.

Q9: What happens if I don’t resolve the suspension?
A: The domain may enter redemption status and eventually be released to the public, depending on your registrar’s policy.

Q10: Are there any fees associated with reactivation?
A: Typically, standard renewal fees apply. Additional verification or late fees may apply if the suspension was due to billing issues.
